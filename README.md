# CustomHookStore

I created Custom Hook that manages my state in the whole app. The purpuse is to replace the Redux store with own built hooks that looks like redux reducers.  
Then only those components that use this hook got updated unlike when the state change in the Redux store and the whole app is re-rendered.  
The app is simple, it is for learning Custom Hooks.  
The app is hosted here: https://customhookstore-aleksandro.netlify.app/
